// A Ballerina function can have included record parameters.
// The included record parameter must be of a `record` type and it cannot be a defaultable parameter.
// A function with included record parameters can be called by providing values for the fields of the included
// record parameters as named arguments using the field names, as if they had been declared as individual parameters.
// Arguments for included record parameters can also be passed as positional arguments.
