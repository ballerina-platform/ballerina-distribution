// A task appointment service can be used to schedule an appointment. The task listener can be provided with an 
// appointment configuration that should have a `cronExpression` field. This is a `string` representing a
// CRON expression. There is an optional
// `noOfRecurrences` field that can be used to provide the maximum number of times
// the appointment should run before shutting down.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Task module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/task/latest/task/).
