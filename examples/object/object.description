// The `object` type is a separate basic type.
// An `object` value has named methods and fields.
// Methods and fields are in the same symbol space.
// A `class` defines an `object` type and provides a way to construct an object.
// Apply the `new` operator with a `class` to get an object.
// Call method using `obj.foo(args)`.
// Access field using `obj.x`.
