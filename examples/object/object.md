# Object

The `object` type is a separate basic type.
An `object` value has named methods and fields.
Methods and fields are in the same symbol space.
A `class` defines an `object` type and provides a way to construct an object.
Apply the `new` operator with a `class` to get an object.
Call method using `obj.foo(args)`.
Access field using `obj.x`.
