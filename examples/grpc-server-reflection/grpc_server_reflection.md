# gRPC service - Server reflection

The `grpc:Listener` provides the server reflection capability, which allows dynamic clients such as command-line tools for debugging to discover the protocol used by a gRPC server at run time. Server reflection is enabled by providing the `reflectionEnabled` configuration in the `grpc:ListenerConfiguration`.

Setting up the service is the same as setting up the simple RPC service with additional configurations. For information on implementing the service, see [gRPC service - Simple RPC](/learn/by-example/grpc-service-simple/).

Run the service by executing the command below.

   ::: out grpc_server_reflection.out :::

After running the service, you can use a tool like [`gRPCurl`](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl), [`Postman`](https://www.postman.com/), [`evans CLI`](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans) to inspect the service.
