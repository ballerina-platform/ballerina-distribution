# HTTP client - Request with multiparts

The multipart payload is one or more different sets of data combined in a single body. The `http:Client` supports multipart content setting and retrieving in the `http:Request` along with the nested parts through support functions. An array of `mime:Entity` is returned when retrieving parts through `getBodyParts` method of the `http:Request`. If the received parts contain nested parts, you can loop through the parent parts and get the child parts. When sending out multipart content, `setBodyParts` is used to set the array of `mime:Entity`. This is useful to handle different content-typed messages as a single payload and large payloads.
