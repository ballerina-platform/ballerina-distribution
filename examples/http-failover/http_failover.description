// Ballerina users can configure multiple HTTP clients in a given failover group. 
// If one of the HTTP clients (dependencies) fails, Ballerina automatically fails over to another endpoint.
// The following example depicts the `FailoverClient` behaviour with three target services. The first two targets
// are configured to mimic failure backends.
// After the first invocation the client resumes the failover from the last successful target. In this case it is
// the third target and the client will get the immediate response for subsequent calls.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
