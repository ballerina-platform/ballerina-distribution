// A GraphQL service in Ballerina represents a GraphQL schema. Each resource function of the `graphql:Service`
// represents a resolver function in the root `Query` type. The return type of each resource function will be the
// type of each field represented by the resource function.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).<br/><br/>
// This example shows a simple GraphQL endpoint that has a single field in the root Query type, which returns a string.
