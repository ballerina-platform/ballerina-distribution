// A service can be secured using basic authentication and optionally, by
// enforcing authorization. The auth provider reads the username and password
// from a file which has a toml format. This stores usernames, passwords for
// authentication, and scopes for authorization.
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource
// declared in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). In the config
// auth provider, scopes are mapped to users.
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the resource are compared against
// the scopes mapped to the user for at least one match between the two sets.
// The following code block shows the contents of the file `sample-users.toml`,
// which has the required format of usernames, passwords and scopes, including
// their mapping.
//
//      [b7a.users]
//
//      [b7a.users.alice]
//      password="password1"
//      scopes="scope1"
//
//      [b7a.users.bob]
//      password="password2"
//      scopes="scope2,scope3"
//
// There are two users defined - Alice and Bob. Each user has a password and
// assigned scopes.<br/><br/>
