# To run this sample, navigate to the directory that contains the
# `.bal` file, and execute the `bal run` command below.

# Use the ballerina `run` command to invoke the `main` function 
# specifying the value `3` as the`after-context` and 
# the value `4` as the `before-context`.
# The values of the `ignore-case`, `recursive`, and `line-number` options 
# can be set to `true` by specifying them explicitly.
# `file` is an optional option argument, which is the the name of `file` with
# newline-separated patterns to search for.
# The operand arguments for `pattern` and `fileName` can be specified along 
# with the options but they have to be specified in the same order. 
# Here, `pattern` is specified as `context` and `fileName` is specified
# as `the_main_function.bal`

bal run the_main_function.bal -- --after-context 3 --before-context=4 --ignore-case --recursive --line-number "context" the_main_function.bal
