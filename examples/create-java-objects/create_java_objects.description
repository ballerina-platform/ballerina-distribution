// jBallerina is an implementation of the Ballerina language specification that targets the JVM.
// Java interoperability in jBallerina enables developers to call existing Java code from Ballerina.
// Ballerina spec describes a reference type called `handle`. A handle value is a reference to
// storage managed externally to a Ballerina program. Handle values cannot be created within a Ballerina program.
// They can be created only by functions with an external function body. In jBallerina handle value refers to
// Java reference value, i.e., a Java object. Also, in jBallerina, Java constructors and Java methods can provide
// the implementations of Ballerina functions that are marked as `external`.
// In this example, let's look at how to create Java objects by invoking their constructors from Ballerina.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Java module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/jballerina.java/latest/jballerina.java/).
