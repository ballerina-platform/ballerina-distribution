// A `table` is a structural value whose members are mapping values that represent rows of the table. A `table`
// provides access to its members using a key that comes from the read-only fields of the member. It keeps its
// members in order but does not provide random access to a member using its position in this order. The built-in
// functions enable inserting, accessing, deleting data, and applying functions on members of a `table`.
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [lang.table module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.table/latest/lang.table/).
