# Service - SSL/TLS

You can use the HTTPS listener to connect to or interact with an HTTPS client.
Provide the `http:ListenerSecureSocket` configurations to the server to
expose an HTTPS connection.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
