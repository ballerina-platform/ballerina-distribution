# GraphQL client - Basic authentication

The `graphql:Client` can connect to a service that is secured with basic authentication by adding the `Authorization: Basic <token>` header to each request. The username and password for basic authentication can be specified in the `auth` field of the `graphql:ClientConfiguration`. Use this to communicate with the service, which is secured with basic authentication.
