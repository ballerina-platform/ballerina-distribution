// This example demonstrates how to use the `sql:ParameterizedQuery` to easily
// create pre-compiled SQL statements that can be reused. Note that the 
// relevant database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml file as a dependency.
// However, this sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database
// driver JAR is included by default into the Ballerina distribution. 
// Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR for H2 databases.<br><br>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [JDBC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/java.jdbc/).
