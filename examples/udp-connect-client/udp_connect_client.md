# UDP client - Send/Receive datagram with connection

The `udp:ConnectClient` connects to a UDP socket, and then sends and receives datagrams. When connected, data may not be received from or sent to any other address. A `udp:ConnectClient` is created by giving the `remoteHost` and `remotePort`. Once connected, `writeBytes` and `readBytes` synchronous methods are used to send and receive byte streams. Since they are synchronous methods often used in two different strands. The client remains connected until it is explicitly disconnected or until it is closed. Use this to interact with UDP servers or implement low latency connections for time-critical transmissions where data loss is acceptable.
