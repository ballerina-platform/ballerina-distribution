// The ConnectClient is configured so that it only receives data from,
// and sends data to, the given remote peer address. Once connected,
// data may not be received from or sent to any other address.
// The client remains connected until it is explicitly disconnected or until it is closed.
// This sample demonstrates how to send data to a connected server and print the echoed response.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [UDP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/udp/).
