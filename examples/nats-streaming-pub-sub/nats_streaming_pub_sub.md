# Publish/subscribe

The `nats` streaming library provides the functionality of a basic publish/subscribe.
In order to run this sample, a NATS Streaming server should be
running on the corresponding port used in the sample.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [STAN module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/stan/latest).
