// Error handling is an integral part of any network program. Errors can be returned
// by many components such as interceptors, dispatcher, data-binder, security handlers, etc.
// These errors are often handled by a default handler and sent back as error responses
// with an entity-body. With the introduction of error interceptors, you can intercept 
// these errors and handle them as you wish. These error interceptors can be placed 
// anywhere in the interceptor pipeline. When there is an error, the execution jumps
// to the closest error interceptor.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
