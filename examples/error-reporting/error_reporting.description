// Ballerina does not have exceptions. Errors are reported by functions returning
// `error` values.
// `error` is its own basic type.
// The return type of a function that may return an `error` value will be a union with `error`.
// An `error` value includes a `string` message.
// An `error` value includes the stack trace from the point at which the error is constructed (i.e., `error(msg)` is called). 
// Error values are immutable.
