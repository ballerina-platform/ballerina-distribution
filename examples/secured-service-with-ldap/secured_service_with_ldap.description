// A service can be secured using LDAP and optionally by enforcing
// authorization. The LDAP auth provider verifies the token against the
// configured LDAP server. The result returned from the LDAP
// server is used for authentication and authorization.
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [LDAP module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ldap/).
