# SOAP client - Send/Receive

The `soap` module provides APIs to connect to a SOAP endpoint that supports SOAP 1.1 or 1.2 versions. Users can specify the version when importing the `soap` module. The `sendReceive()` API will send a request to a SOAP endpoint and bind the response to one of the `xml` or `mime:Entity[]` data types determined by the user. The `sendOnly()` API only sends a request to a SOAP endpoint.
