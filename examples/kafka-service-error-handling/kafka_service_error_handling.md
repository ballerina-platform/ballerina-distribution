# Kafka service - Error handling

The `kafka:Service` has an `onError` method which is invoked when `kafka:Listener` triggers errors before the `onConsumerRecord` method is invoked. These errors could include payload binding errors or constraint validation errors. The `onError` method allows the user to handle these errors as needed. If there is no `onError` method in the `kafka:Service`, these are logged to the console with the stack-trace. In addition, `kafka:Service` allows returning errors from the `onConsumerRecord` method. These errors are also logged to the console and the next polling cycle will continue.
