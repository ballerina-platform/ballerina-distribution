// It is a separate basic type and belongs to the `anydata` type.
// There is no implicit conversions between `decimal` and other numeric types.
// It can represent `decimal` fractions exactly and it preserves precision.
// The `decimal` type does not include infinity, NaN, or negative zero.
// It supports floating-point precision to 34 decimal digits.
