// Ballerina provides the capability to easily introduce webhooks via its implementation of the WebSub recommendation.
//
// Ballerina Services, which act as WebSub Publishers could start up a Ballerina WebSub Hub to which they would publish
// updates against topics on the occurrence of particular events.
//
// Ballerina WebSub subscribers can subscribe at these hubs, by specifying the topics, to receive notifications on
// the occurrence of particular events.
//
// Any of the Ballerina's WebSub components (Publisher, Hub, or Subscriber) could be used with non-Ballerina components, which
// are WebSub-compliant.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [WebSub module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/websub/latest/websub/).
