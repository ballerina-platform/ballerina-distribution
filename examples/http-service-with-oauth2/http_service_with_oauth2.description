// An HTTP service/resource can be secured using OAuth2 and by enforcing
// authorization optionally. Then, it validates the OAuth2 token sent in the
// `Authorization` header against the provided configurations. This calls the
// configured introspection endpoint to validate.<br/>
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). The scope can be included
// in the introspection response using a custom claim attribute. That custom
// claim attribute is also can be configured as the `scopeKey`.<br/>
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared
// against the scope included in the introspection response for at least one
// match between the two sets.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [OAuth2 module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/oauth2/latest/oauth2/).
