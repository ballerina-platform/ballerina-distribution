# RabbitMQ client - Declare queue

In this example, the RabbitMQ client is declaring a queue. Queues in RabbitMQ are ordered collections of messages. Messages are enqueued and dequeued in the FIFO manner.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`rabbitmq` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/rabbitmq/latest).
