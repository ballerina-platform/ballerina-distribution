# RabbitMQ client - Declare queue

A RabbitMQ queue is a buffer that stores messages. The queue takes messages from the publisher and sends them to the consumer. A `rabbitmq:Client` is created with the host and port of the RabbitMQ broker. A queue with a specific name and custom configurations can be declared by using the `queueDeclare` method. To create a queue with a server-generated name, the `queueAutoGenerate` method can be used. Use this to declare the queue before publishing messages.
