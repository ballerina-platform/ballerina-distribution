# gRPC service - Basic authentication LDAP user store

The `grpc:Service` can be secured with basic authentication and additionally, scopes can be added to enforce authorization. It validates the basic authentication token sent in the `Authorization` metadata with the LDAP server. This server stores the usernames and passwords for the authentication and the scopes for the authorization. To engage authentication, set the LDAP-related configurations to the `ldapUserStoreConfig` field. To engage authorization, set the scopes to the `scopes` field. Both configurations must be given as part of the service configuration.

A `grpc:UnauthenticatedError` is sent to the client when the authentication fails, and a `grpc:PermissionDeniedError` is sent to the client when the authorization fails. Use this to authenticate and authorize requests based on LDAP user stores.

Setting up the service is the same as setting up the simple RPC service with additional configurations. For information on implementing the service, see [gRPC service - Simple RPC](/learn/by-example/grpc-service-simple/).

## Prerequisites
- Run the LDAP server.

Run the service by executing the command below.

   ::: out grpc_service_basic_auth_ldap_user_store.server.out :::

>**Tip:** You can invoke the above service via the [gRPC client - Basic authentication](/learn/by-example/grpc-client-basic-auth).
