// A client, which is secured with OAuth2 Authentication should be used
// to connect to a service, which is secured with OAuth2 Authentication.
// The `oauth2:OutboundOAuth2Provider` is initialized with the relevant
// configurations passed as a record. The `http:BearerAuthHandler`
// is initialized by providing the created `oauth2:OutboundOAuth2Provider`.
// An additional `auth` field is added to the HTTP client endpoint
// initialization in order to secure the simple HTTP client endpoint.
// The `authHandler` field is defined inside the `auth` field with the
// value of it being the reference of the created `http:BearerAuthHandler`.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [OAuth2 module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/oauth2/latest/oauth2/).
