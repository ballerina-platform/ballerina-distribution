# As a prerequisite, start a sample WebSocket service, which sends a message to the client upon upgrading to a WebSocket connection.
# If you are using a Ballerina WebSocket server, you can send a message to the client in the `onOpen` resource.
# The client will first connect to the server and then it will wait for 5 seconds to give time for the server to shut down.
# Start the server after 5 seconds so that the client will start retrying to connect to the server and read messages.
