// `On-fail` catches failures (from the fail statement or failure of a check expression) but not panics.
// On fail clause is supported for do, transactions, retry, lock, match, foreach and while statements.
// On fail will be executed if the block statement following supported statement fails.
// The type of error caught from on-fail clause will be union of the error types that can be
// returned by the block statement.
