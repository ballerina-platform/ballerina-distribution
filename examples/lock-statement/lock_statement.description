// The `lock` statement allows mutable state to be safely accessed from multiple strands that are running on
// separate threads. Semantics are like an atomic section. The execution of the outermost `lock` block is not
// interleaved. Naive implementation uses single, global, recursive lock. Efficient implementation can do
// compile-time lock inference.
