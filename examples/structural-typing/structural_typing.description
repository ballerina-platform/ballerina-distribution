// Typing in Ballerina is structural: a type describes a set of values. Ballerina has semantic subtyping:
// subtype means subset. Universe of values is partitioned into basic types. Each value belongs to
// exactly one basic type. You can think of each value as being tagged with its basic type.
// There is a complexity in making structural typing work with mutation. <br/><br/>
// Immutable basic types (so far): `nil`, `boolean`, `int`, `float`, `string` <br/><br/>
// Mutable basic types (so far): `array`, `map`, and `record`
