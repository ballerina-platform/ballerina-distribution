# Service - OAuth2

A gRPC service/resource can be secured with OAuth2 and by enforcing authorization optionally. Then, it validates the OAuth2 token sent in the `Authorization` metadata against the provided configurations. This calls the configured introspection endpoint to validate.

Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). The scope can be included in the introspection response using a custom claim attribute. That custom claim attribute also can be configured as the `scopeKey`.

In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared against the scope included in the introspection response for at least one match between the two sets.

>**Info:** For more information on the underlying module, see the [`oauth2` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/oauth2/latest/).

## Generate the service definition

1. Create a new Protocol Buffers definition file named `grpc_service.proto` and add the service definition to it.

    ::: code grpc_service.proto :::

2. Run the command below in the Ballerina tools distribution for stub generation.

   ::: out grpc_service.out :::

Once you run the command, the `grpc_service_pb.bal` file is generated inside the stubs directory.

>**Info:** For more information on how to use the Ballerina Protocol Buffers tool, see the [Proto To Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/proto-to-ballerina.html) example.

## Implement and run the service

1. Create a Ballerina package.

2. Copy the generated `grpc_secured_pb.bal` stub file to the package. For example, if you create a package named `service`, copy the stub file to the `service` package.

3. Create a new `grpc_service_oauth2.bal` Ballerina file inside the `service` package and add the service implementation.

   ::: code grpc_service_oauth2.bal :::

4. Execute the commands below to build and run the `service` package.

>**Info:** You may need to change the certificate file path and private key file path.

   ::: out grpc_service_oauth2.server.out :::
