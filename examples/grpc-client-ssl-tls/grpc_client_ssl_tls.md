# Client - SSL/TLS

You can use the gRPC client to connect or interact with a gRPC listener secured with SSL/TLS. Provide the `grpc:ClientSecureSocket` configurations to the client to initiate an HTTPS connection over HTTP/2.

>**Info:** For more information on the underlying module, see the [`grpc` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/).

## Generate the service definition

1. Create a new Protocol Buffers definition file named `grpc_client.proto` and add the service definition to it.

   ::: code grpc_client.proto :::

2. Run the command below in the Ballerina tools distribution for stub generation.

   ::: out grpc_client.out :::

Once you run the command, the `grpc_client_pb.bal` file is generated inside the stubs directory.

>**Info:** For more information on how to use the Ballerina Protocol Buffers tool, see the [Proto To Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/proto-to-ballerina.html) example.

## Implement and run the client

1. Create a Ballerina package.

2. Copy the generated `grpc_secured_pb.bal` stub file to the package. For example, if you create a package named `client`, copy the stub file to the `client` package.

3. Create a new `grpc_client_ssl_tls.bal` Ballerina file inside the `client` package and add the client implementation.

   >**Tip:** You may need to change the trusted certificate file path in the code below. 
   
   ::: code grpc_client_ssl_tls.bal :::

4. Execute the commands below to build and run the `client` package.

   >**Info:** As a prerequisite to running the client, start a [sample service secured with SSL/TLS](earn/by-example/grpc-service-ssl-tls/).

   ::: out grpc_client_ssl_tls.out :::
