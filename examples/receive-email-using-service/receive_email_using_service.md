# Email service - Receive email

The `email:Service` receives messages from an email server via IMAP using the `email:ImapListener`. An `email:ImapListener` can be initialized by providing the hostname, username, and password. Once connected, `onMessage` method is invoked whenever an email is read from the email server. If there is an error while reading the data from the server, `onError` method is invoked with relevant error details. When the email server supports both POP3 and IMAP, it is recommended to use the IMAP as it provides the ability to manage emails using multiple devices or email clients, while allowing access to emails that are already read. 

>**Note:** The Ballerina `email` module also provides an `email:PopListener` which can be used likewise. The only difference is that the `email:PopListener` uses POP3 protocol for communication.
