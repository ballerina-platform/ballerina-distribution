# REST service - Payload data binding

HTTP service payload data binding allows accessing the request payload using a resource signature parameter. The resource parameter which is bound to the request payload should be annotated with `@http:Payload` annotation. The resource parameter type should be `anydata`. If the data binding fails, a `400 Bad Request` response is sent to the client. Use this to access the request payload directly from the resource.

::: code http_service_data_binding.bal :::

Run the service as follows.

::: out http_service_data_binding.server.out :::

Invoke the service by executing the following cURL command in a new terminal.

::: out http_service_data_binding.client.out :::

>**Tip:** You can invoke the above service via the [Send request/Receive response client](/learn/by-example/http-client-send-request-receive-response/) example.
