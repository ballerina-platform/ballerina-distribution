// In Ballerina GraphQL, a service represents the GraphQL endpoint.
// Each resource function inside the service represents a resolver function for a field in the root Query type.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/graphql/).<br/><br/>
// This example shows a GraphQL endpoint, which has a field `profile` of type `Person`.
// A GraphQL client can query on this service to retrieve specific fields or subfields of the `Person` object.
