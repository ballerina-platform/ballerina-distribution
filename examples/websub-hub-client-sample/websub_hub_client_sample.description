// Ballerina provides the capability to easily introduce publishers and subscribers that are WebSub-compliant.
// Ballerina WebSub subscribers can specify the topic they wish to subscribe to and the hub they wish to subscribe at,
// to receive notifications. If specified, the subscription process would be initiated at the startup.
// The subscription/unsubscription process could also be initiated via the Ballerina WebSub Hub Client Endpoint.
//
// This example demonstrates the usage of the WebSub Hub Client Endpoint to subscribe and unsubscribe to updates for
// a particular topic at the hub. Also, it demonstrates auto intent verification in which intent verification for subscription or
// unsubscription requests would happen automatically (against the annotated topic) if the onIntentVerification request
// is not included.
//
// The Hub Client Endpoint can be used by subscribers to subscribe/unsubscribe at a Hub, and by publishers to
// register topics and publish updates for topics at the Hub.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [WebSub module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/websub/latest/websub/).
