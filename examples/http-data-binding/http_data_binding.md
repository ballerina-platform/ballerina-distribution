# Service data binding

HTTP service data binding helps to access the request payload through a resource signature parameter. The payload parameter should be declared with the `@Payload` annotation and the  parameter type can be `anydata`. Binding failures will be responded with `400[Bad Request]` response.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`http` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
