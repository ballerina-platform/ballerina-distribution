//This sample demonstrates how to configure the chunking behavior of an HTTP client endpoint. By default, the HTTP client sends messages with the `content-length` header.
//If the message size is larger than the buffer size (8K), messages are chunked. Chunking can be disabled using the connector options.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/http/).
