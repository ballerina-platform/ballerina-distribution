# WebSocket client - SSL/TLS

The `websocket:Client` secured with SSL/TLS connects to a given SSL/TLS-secured WebSocket server (WSS). A `websocket:Client` secured with SSL/TLS is created by providing the `secureSocket` configurations which require the server's public certificate as the `cert`. Use this to interact with TLS-encrypted WebSocket servers.
