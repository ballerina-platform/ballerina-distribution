// connect to a service, which is secured with Basic authentication.
// The `auth:OutboundBasicAuthProvider` is initialized with the `username` and
// `password` and the `http:BasicAuthHandler` is initialized by providing
// the created `auth:OutboundBasicAuthProvider`. An additional `auth` field is
// added to the HTTP  client endpoint initialization in order to secure the
// simple HTTP client endpoint.

// it being the reference of the created `http:BearerAuthHandler`.<br/><br/>
