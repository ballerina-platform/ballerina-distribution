// Client data binding helps to access the response payload directly as a return value. The `targetType` dafaultable
// parameter in the client remote function signature expects a `typedesc` of a possible payload type out of
// `string`|`xml`|`json`|`map<json>`|`byte[]`|`record`|`record[]` and `http:Response`.
// A successful data binding process will return the payload in the given `targetType`. When the user expects client
// data binding to happen, the HTTP error responses (4XX, 5XX)  will be categorized as an `http:ClientError` of the
// client remote operation. Since the default `targetType` is `http:Response`, the user still has the option to access
// the complete response to explore more.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/http/).
