// Through client data binding, the response payload can be accessed directly. The payload type is inferred from the
// contextually-expected type or from the `targetType` argument. An `anydata` type or `http:Response` is expected as
// the return value type along with the error.
// When the user expects client data binding to happen, the HTTP error responses (4XX, 5XX) will be categorized
// as an `error` (`http:ClientRequestError`, `http:RemoteServerError`) of the client remote operation.
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [HTTP module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
