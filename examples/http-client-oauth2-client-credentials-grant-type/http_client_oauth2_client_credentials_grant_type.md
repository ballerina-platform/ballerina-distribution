# Client - OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type

A client, which is secured with OAuth2 client credentials grant type can be used to connect to a secured service.

The client is enriched with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header by passing the `http:OAuth2ClientCredentialsGrantConfig` for the `auth` configuration of the client.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`oauth2` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/oauth2/latest/).
