# Asynchronous function calls

`start` calls a function asynchronously and the function runs on a separate logical thread (`strand`). It is cooperatively multitasked by default.

The result will be of type `future<T>` and `future` is a separate basic type. Waiting for the same `future` more than once gives an `error`. Use `f.cancel()` to terminate a `future`.
