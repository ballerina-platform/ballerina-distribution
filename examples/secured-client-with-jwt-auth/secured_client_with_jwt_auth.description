// A secured client, which is secured  with JWT authentication should be used
// to connect to a service, which is secured with JWT authentication.
// The `jwt:OutboundJWTAuthProvider` is initialized with/without passing
// the JWT issuer configurations as a record. If the JWT issuer configurations
// are passed, a new JWT will be issued and it will be used for the outbound
// authentication. If the JWT issuer configurations are not passed,
// a JWT will be searched in `runtime:AuthenticationContext` and it will be
// used for the outbound authentication.
// The `http:BearerAuthHandler` is initialized by  providing
// the created `jwt:OutboundBasicAuthProvider`. An additional `auth` field is
// added to the HTTP client endpoint initialization in order to secure the
// simple HTTP client endpoint.
// The `authHandler` field is defined inside the `auth` field with the value
// of it being the reference of the created `http:BearerAuthHandler`.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
