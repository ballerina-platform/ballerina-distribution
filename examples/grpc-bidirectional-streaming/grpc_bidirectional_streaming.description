// The gRPC Server Connector exposes the gRPC service over HTTP2.
// In a gRPC bidirectional streaming scenario, the gRPC service and the client
// operate when each other sends a sequence of messages using a read-write stream.
// In such scenarios, the two streams operate independently. Therefore, clients and servers can read and write in any order.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [GRPC module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/).
