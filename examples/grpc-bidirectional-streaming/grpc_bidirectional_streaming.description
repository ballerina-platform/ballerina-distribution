// The gRPC Server Connector exposes the gRPC service over http2.
// This sample demonstrates how the gRPC bidirectional streaming service and the non blocking client 
// operate when each of them sends a sequence of messages using a read-write stream. 
// In such scenarios, the two streams operate independently. Therefore, clients and servers can read and write in any order.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [GRPC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/grpc/).
