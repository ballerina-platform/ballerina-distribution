# Binary data

Binary data is represented by arrays of `byte` values. It is a special syntax for `byte` arrays
in `base 64` and `base 16`. The relationship between `byte` and `int` is not the same as
what you are used to. A `byte` is an `int` in the range `0` to `0xFF`. `byte` is a subtype of int.
`int` type supports normal bitwise operators: `&` `|` `^` `~` `<<` `>>` `>>>`.
Ballerina knows the obvious rules about when bitwise operations produce a `byte`.
