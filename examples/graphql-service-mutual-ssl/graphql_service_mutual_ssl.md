# Service - Mutual SSL

Ballerina supports mutual SSL, which is a certificate-based authentication
process in which two parties (the client and server) authenticate each other by
verifying the digital certificates. It ensures that both parties are assured
of each other's identity.

For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [GraphQL module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
