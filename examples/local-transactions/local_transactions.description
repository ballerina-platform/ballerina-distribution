// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby, leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This sample uses an H2 database, which is 
// created when running the sample. <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Transactions module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.transaction/latest/lang.transaction/).
