# Client - SSL/TLS

You can use the HTTPS client to connect or interact with an HTTPS listener. Provide the `http:ClientSecureSocket` configurations to the client to initiate an HTTPS connection.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`http` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/) 
and [`http` specification](https://ballerina.io/spec/http/#923-client---ssltls).
