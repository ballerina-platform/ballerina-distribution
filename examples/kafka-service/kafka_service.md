# Consumer service

Here, a Kafka consumer is used as a listener to a service with automatic offset commits. For this to work properly, an active Kafka broker should be present.

For more information on the underlying module,  see the [`kafka` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/kafka/latest).
