# Email service - SSL/TLS 

The `email:Service` receives messages from an email server via IMAP using the `email:ImapListener`. An `email:ImapListener` secured with SSL/TLC is created by providing the `secureSocket` configuration which requires the certificate of the email server as the `cert`. In addition to the certificate configuration, an optional `security` configuration is available to define the underlying transport protocol which needs to be used. The Ballerina `email` module supports both `STARTTLS` and `SSL` as the transport protocol. Use this to interact with email servers based on SSL/TLS encrypted secured connection.  

>**Note:** The Ballerina `email` module also provides an `email:PopListener` which can be used likewise.
