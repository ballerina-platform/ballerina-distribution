# Basic REST API

Ballerina supports writing RESTful with its first class service and resource concepts. 
The `accessor-name`, service/resource name, data binding, path and query parameter support helps to write meaningful 
APIs. The sample depicts the way of writing `GET` and `POST` resources

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`http` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
