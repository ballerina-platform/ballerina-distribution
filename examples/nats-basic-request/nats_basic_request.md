# NATS client - Send request message

The `nats:Client` allows sending request messages to a given subject. A `nats:Client` is created by passing the URL of the NATS broker. The `requestMessage` method can be used to send requests to the NATS server by providing a target subject, an optional reply subject, the message content, and an optional duration for the timeout. After the request is sent, the application waits on the response with the given timeout. Use it to send request messages, which expect a reply back.
