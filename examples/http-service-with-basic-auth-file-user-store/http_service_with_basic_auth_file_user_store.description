// An HTTP service/resource can be secured using Basic auth and optionally by
// enforcing authorization. Then, it validates the Basic auth token sent in the
// `Authorization` header against the provided configurations. This reads data
// from a file, which has a TOML format. This stores the usernames, passwords
// for authentication, and scopes for authorization.<br/>
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s).<br/>
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared
// against the scope included in the user store for at least one match between
// the two sets.<br/>
// `Config.toml` has defined three users - Alice, Bob and Eve. Each user has a
// password and optionally assigned scopes as an array.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [Auth module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest/auth/).
