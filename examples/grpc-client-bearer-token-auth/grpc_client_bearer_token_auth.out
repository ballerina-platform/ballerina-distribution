# Create a Ballerina package.
# Copy the generated `grpc_secured_pb.bal` stub file to the package.
# For example, if you create a package named `client`, copy the stub file to the `client` package.

# Create a new `grpc_client_bearer_token_auth.bal` Ballerina file inside the `client` package and add the client implementation.

# Execute the command below to build the 'client' package.
# You may need to change the trusted certificate file path.
`bal build client`

# Run the client using the command below.
# As a prerequisite, start a secured sample service.
bal run client/target/bin/client.jar
