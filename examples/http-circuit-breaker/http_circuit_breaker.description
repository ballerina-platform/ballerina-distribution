// The Circuit Breaker is used to gracefully handle network related errors, which occur when using the HTTP Client. Behavior of this example is something similar to as follows,
// 1) First two requests works, 2) Third request fails and the circuit breaker trips, 3) As a result subsequent requests fails immediately until the timeout period is reached,
// 4) Timeout is reached and the circuit breaker falls back to closed state. <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
