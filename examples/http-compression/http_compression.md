# HTTP service - Compression

The `http:Service` can be configured to change the compression behaviour of the `http:Response` payload. By default, the server compresses the response entity body with the scheme(gzip, deflate) that is specified in the `Accept-Encoding` request header. When the particular header is not present, or the header value is `identity`, the server does not perform any compression. Compression is disabled when the option is set to `COMPRESSION_NEVER` and always enabled when the option is set to `COMPRESSION_ALWAYS`. In the same way `http:Client` can be configured as well.

::: code http_compression.bal :::

Run the service as follows.

::: out http_compression.server.out :::

Invoke the service by executing the following cURL command in a new terminal.
Here, the `Accept-Encoding` header is not specified.

::: out http_compression.client.out :::
