// This example demonstrates how to use the MySQL client with complex data types
// such as binary, blobs, and date/time fields. Note that the MySQL database
// driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency.
// See [MySQL module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql/latest/) for sample configuration.
// The MySQL connector uses some database properties from MySQL version 8.0.x
// onwards. Therefore, it is recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater
// than 8.0.x.<br><br>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [MySQL module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql/latest/).
