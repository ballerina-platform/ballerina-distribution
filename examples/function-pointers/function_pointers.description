// Ballerina allows the user to define variables of function types. This allows you to use
// functions in similar contexts as other values. e.g., as variables, arguments to
// functions, and return values of functions. The name of a function or a function variable
// serves as a reference to that function when it is used in an expression context.
// The type of a function is given by the signature of the function.
