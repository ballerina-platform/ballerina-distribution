// A task timer service can be used to execute tasks periodically. The task listener can be provided with a 
// timer configuration that should have an `intervalInMillis` field specified and an `initialDelayInMillis` field if
// needed. The delay specifies the initial delay before the task is executed
// for the first time. Thereafter, the timer triggers at the provided interval.
// The `onTrigger()` resource is called when the timer triggers. An optional
// `noOfRecurrences` field can be used to provide the maximum number of times
// the timer should run before shutting down.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Task module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/task/).
