// Ballerina supports encoding and decoding multipart content in HTTP responses along with the nested parts.
// When you request multiparts from an HTTP inbound response, you get an array of the parts of the body (an array of
// entities). If the received parts contain nested parts, you can loop through the parent parts and get the child parts.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Mime module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/mime/latest/mime/).
