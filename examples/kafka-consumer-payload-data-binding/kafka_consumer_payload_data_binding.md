# Kafka consumer - Payload data binding

The payload data-binding allows you to directly bind Kafka messages to subtypes of `anydata`. It does this by using the built-in bytes deserializer for both the key and the value. To use this, directly assign the `pollPayload` methodâ€™s return value to the declared variable, which is a subtype of `anydata[]`. If the payload does not match with the defined type, a `kafka:PayloadBindingError` is returned. The `seek` method of the `kafka:Consumer` can be used to seek past the erroneous record and read the new records. Use this to receive messages from a Kafka server without the metadata of the messages like `kafka:PartitionOffset` and `timestamp`. It is important to note that this only works when `kafka:Producer` also uses the built-in bytes serializer for Ballerina.

## Prerequisites
- Start a [Kafka broker](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) instance.

Run the program by executing the following command.

::: out kafka_consumer_payload_data_binding.out :::

>**Tip:** Run the Kafka client given in the [Kafka producer - Produce message](/learn/by-example/kafka-producer-produce-message) example to produce some messages to the topic.
