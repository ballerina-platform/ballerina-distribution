# To run this sample, create a new TOML file with name `configuration.toml` in the
# same directory as the `.bal` file.

# The TOML file must contain the following,
#
# hostName = "192.0.1.2"
# port = 9090
# enableRemote = false
# maxPayload = 0.321

# Then, navigate to the directory that contains the `.bal` and
# `configuration.toml` files, and execute the `ballerina run` command below.

ballerina run configurable.bal
