// By default, named workers are multitasked cooperatively, not preemptively.
// Each named worker has a "strand" (logical thread of control) and the execution
// switches between strands only at specific "yield" points such as doing a wait
// or when a library function invokes a system call that would block.
// This avoids the need for you to lock variables that are accessed from
// multiple named workers.
