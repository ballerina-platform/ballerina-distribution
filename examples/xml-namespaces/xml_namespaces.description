// The goal is to support namespaces without adding complexity if you donâ€™t use them. The 
// `ns:x` qualified name in XML is expanded into `{url}x` where `url` is the namespace name bound to `ns`. The XML namespace
// declarations are kept as attributes using the standard binding of [xmlns](http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/).
