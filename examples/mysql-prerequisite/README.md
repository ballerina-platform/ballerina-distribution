# Database Access Ballerina By Example - Prerequisites

`Database Access` BBEs are based on a Music Store use-case.

To set up the MySQL database to run the BBEs, run the bal files by executing the command `bal run`.
1. setup_database.bal - This creates the `MUSIC_STORE` database and necessary tables.
2. create_stored_procedure.bal - This creates the `get_sales_order` procedure.
