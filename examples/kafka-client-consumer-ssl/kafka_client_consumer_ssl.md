# Kafka client - Consumer SSL/TLS

This shows how the SSL encryption is done in the `kafka:Consumer`. For this to work properly, an active Kafka server must be present, and it should be configured to use SSL.

>**Info:** For more information on the underlying module, see the [`kafka` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/kafka/latest).
