# Covariance

Arrays and maps are covariant. Static type-checking guarantees that the result of a read from a mutable structure will be consistent with the static type.

Covariance means that a write to a mutable structure may result in a runtime error. Arrays, maps, and records have an `inherent` type that constrains mutation.
