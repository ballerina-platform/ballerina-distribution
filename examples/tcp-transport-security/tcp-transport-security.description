// This example demonstrates how the Ballerina TCP client can be configured to
// connect to an SSL/TLS listener through a one-way SSL/TLS connection 
// (i.e., the server is verified by the client). This example uses the Ballerina
// TCP listener to host a service and the TCP client sends 
// requests to that listener.

// For more information on the underlying module, see the [TCP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/tcp/latest/tcp).
