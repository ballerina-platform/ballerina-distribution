// A `task:Scheduler` can be used to schedule an appointment. An appointment configuration should
// have a `cronExpression` field. It is a `string` representing a
// CRON expression. There is an optional `noOfRecurrences` field that can be used to
// provide the maximum number of times the appointment should run before shutting down.<br/><br/>
// A service can be attached to the scheduler using the `attach()` method.
// Then, the scheduler can be started using the `start()` method. When the scheduler
// needs to be cancelled, the `stop()` method can be called.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Task module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/task/latest/task/).
