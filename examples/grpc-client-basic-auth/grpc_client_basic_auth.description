// A client, which is secured with Basic Auth can be used to connect to
// a secured service.<br/>
// The client metadata is enriched with the `Authorization: Basic <token>`
// header by passing the `grpc:CredentialsConfig` for the `auth` configuration
// of the client.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [Auth module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest/).
