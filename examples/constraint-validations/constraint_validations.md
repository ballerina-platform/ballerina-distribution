Validating user input is a common requirement in most applications. 
This can prevent user entry errors before the app attempts to process the data. 
The `constraint` library provides such validations for the following Ballerina types : `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `string` and `anydata[]`.
For more information on the underlying module,
see the [`constraint` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/constraint/latest/).
