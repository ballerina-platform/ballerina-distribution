# Constraint validations

Validating user input is a common requirement in most applications.  This can prevent user entry errors before the app attempts to process the data. 

The `constraint` library provides such validations for the following Ballerina types: `int`, `float`, `decimal`, `string`, and `anydata[]`.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`constraint` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/constraint/latest/).
