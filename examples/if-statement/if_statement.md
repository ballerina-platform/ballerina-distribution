# If statements

`if` statements are used for conditional execution. Conditions following `if` must be boolean and if the condition is true, then, the corresponding statement block is executed. If the condition of the `if` statement is false, then, one of the following `else if` blocks executes if the particular `else if` statement condition is true. If none of the conditions are true, then, the `else` block executes.
