// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client with complex data types
// such as arrays, binary, blobs, clob, and date/time fields. Note that the
// relevant database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml file as a dependency.
// However, this sample is based on an H2
// database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by  default in the
// Ballerina distribution. Therefore, it is not required to copy the driver JAR
// for the H2 database.<br><br>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [JDBC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/).
