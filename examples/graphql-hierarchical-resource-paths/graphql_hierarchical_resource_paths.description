// The resources in Ballerina GraphQL services can have hierarchical resource paths. When a hierarchical
// resource is found, a new GraphQL type will be created for each intermediate path, which will have its
// sub paths as fields.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/graphql/).<br/><br/>
// This example shows a GraphQL endpoint, which has a `profile` field of type `Person`.
// A GraphQL client can query this service to retrieve specific fields or subfields of the `Person` object.
