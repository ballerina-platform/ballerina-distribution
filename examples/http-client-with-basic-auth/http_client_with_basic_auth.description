// A client, which is secured with Basic auth can be used to connect to
// a secured service.<br/>
// The client is enriched with the `Authorization: Basic <token>` header by
// passing the `http:CredentialsConfig` for the `auth` configuration of the
// client.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [Auth module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest/auth/).
