// With mutable values, it would not be type-safe to allow a cast.
// Mutable structures have the `inherent` type that limits mutation.
// Cast to `T` will work on mutable structure `s` only if the `inherent` type
// of `s` is a subtype of `T`.
// Casting immutable values will work but it does not do numeric conversions.
