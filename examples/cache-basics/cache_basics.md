# Cache basics

The `cache` library provides in-memory cache implementation APIs and
uses the `Least Recently Used` algorithm-based eviction policy.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`cache` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/cache/latest/).

This example illustrates the basic operations provided by the `cache` library.
