// A client, which is secured with self-signed JWT can be used to connect to
// a secured service.<br/>
// The client is enriched with the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header by
// passing the `http:JwtIssuerConfig` to the `auth` configuration of the
// client. A self-signed JWT is issued before the request is sent.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [OAuth2 module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/oauth2/latest/oauth2/).
