# Table types

A `table` is a collection of records where each record represents a row of the `table`. Each row of the `table` is uniquely identified by a key. This key must be immutable, and each rowâ€™s key is stored in its fields.
Compared to maps,
- key is part of the value rather than being separate.
- The type of the key is not restricted to string.
- The order of the members is preserved.
