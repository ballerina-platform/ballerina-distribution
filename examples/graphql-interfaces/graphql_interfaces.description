// A GraphQL schema can have interface types. Then, the other object types can
// implement the interfaces. All the types that are implementing an interface
// must consist of the common set of fields defined in the interface type.
// <br/><br/>
// In Ballerina, `distinct` `service` classes are used to define interfaces and
// to define objects that are implementing the interfaces. The Ballerina type
// inclusions are used to mark an object as an interface implementation.
// <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
