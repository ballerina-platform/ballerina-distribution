$ bal persist init --module store

Initialized persistence in your Ballerina project.

Your Persist schema is at persist/model.bal.
You can now update it with entity definitions.

Next steps:
Run bal persist generate to generate the Ballerina Client, Types, and Scripts. You can then start querying your database.
