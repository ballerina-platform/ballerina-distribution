// The `nats` streaming library allows creating durable subscriptions.
// Regular subscriptions remember
// their position while the client is connected. If the client
// disconnects, the position is lost. Durable subscriptions
// remember their position even if the client is disconnected.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
