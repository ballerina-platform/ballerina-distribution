// This sample demonstrates creating a durable subscription
// in the NATS Streaming server. Regular subscriptions remember
// their position while the client is connected. If the client
// disconnects, the position is lost. Durable subscriptions
// remember their position even if the client is disconnected.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [NATS module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/nats/latest).
