// The gRPC Server Connector is used to expose gRPC services over HTTP/2.
// This sample includes a gRPC server streaming service and a non-blocking client. The
// client sends a request to the server and gets a stream to read the messages until all the messages are read.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [GRPC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/grpc/).
