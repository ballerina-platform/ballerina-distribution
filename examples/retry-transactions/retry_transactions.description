// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby, leaving the
// system in a consistent state. A retry transaction statement combines
// the retry statement and the transaction statement with the
// additional semantics that each transaction is part of a sequence of
// retries. This sample uses an H2 database, which is
// created when running the sample. <br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Transactions module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.transaction/latest/).
