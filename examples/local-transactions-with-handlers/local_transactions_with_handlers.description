// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby, leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This example demonstrates how to use
// transaction util methods and the various usages of them.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Transactions module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/lang.transaction/latest/lang.transaction/).
