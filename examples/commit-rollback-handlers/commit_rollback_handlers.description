// Often code needs to get executed depending on whether a transaction is committed.
// Testing the result of the `commit` within the transaction statement works. However, it is inconvenient
// from a modularity perspective, particularly, when you want to undo changes on `rollback`.
// This seems much worse in a distributed transaction when the transaction statement is in another program.
// Ballerina provides `commit`/`rollback` handlers, which are functions that get executed when the decision
// whether to commit is known.
