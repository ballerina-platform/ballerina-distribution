# WebSocket client - Send/Receive message

The `websocket:Client` connects to a given WebSocket server, and then sends and receives WebSocket frames. A `websocket:Client` is created by giving the URL of the server. Once connected, `writeMessage` and `readMessage` synchronous methods are used to send and receive messages. Since they are synchronous methods often used in two different strands. Use this to interact with WebSocket servers or implement user applications based on WebSocket.
