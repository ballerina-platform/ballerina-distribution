>**Note:** The relevant database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency. This sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR need to be added to `Ballerina.toml` file. This sample is written using H2 2.1.210 and it is recommended to use H2 JAR with versions higher than 2.1.210.

For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [`jdbc` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/).
