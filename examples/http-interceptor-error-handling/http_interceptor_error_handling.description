// Errors that occurred in the request-response pipeline can be intercepted and handled
// by `ResponseErrorInterceptors`. In addition, a `RequestErrorInterceptor` 
// can be used to handle the errors that occurred in the request interceptor execution
// path. The `RequestErrorInterceptor` can send a response message according to the 
// error just like a `ResponseErrorInterceptor`. Moreover, it can modify the 
// request and dipatch it to the target service.
  // For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
