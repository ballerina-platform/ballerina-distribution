// An object can be made iterable as a sequence of values of type `T` using type inclusion with `lang.object:Iterable` 
// and providing a method named `iterator` which returns an iterator that is a subtype of
// `object { public isolated function next() returns record {| T value; |}|C;}` in which `C` is the completion type.
// An iterable object is denoted as `Iterable<T, C>` and an iterator as `Iterator<T, C>`. An
// iterable object which does not return an error in the next method can be iterated over using a `foreach` loop.
// In this example, `IteratorGenerator` is a subtype of `Iterable<int,()>` and `ArrayIterator` is a subtype
// of `Iterator<int,()>`.
