# NATS client - Publish message

The `nats:Client` allows publishing messages to a given subject. A `nats:Client` is created by passing the URL of the NATS broker. To publish messages, the `publishMessage` method is used, which requires the message and subject as arguments. Use it to publish messages that can be received by one or more subscribers.
