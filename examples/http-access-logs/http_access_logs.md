# Access logs

Ballerina supports HTTP access logs for HTTP services. The access log format used is the combined log format. To enable access logs, set `console=true` under the `ballerina.http.accessLogConfig` in the `Config.toml` file. Also, the `path` field can be used to specify the file path to save the access logs.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`http` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
