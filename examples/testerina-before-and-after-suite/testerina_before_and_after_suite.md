# Before and after suite

The `BeforeSuite` annotation allows you to execute a function before executing a test suite.
Similarly, the `AfterSuite` annotation can be used to execute a function after a test suite.<br/><br/>
A module is considered as a suite in the Test framework. <br></br>
These annotations can be used to set up prerequisites and post actions for a test suite.
