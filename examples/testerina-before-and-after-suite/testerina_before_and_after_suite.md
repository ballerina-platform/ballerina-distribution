# Before and after suite

The `BeforeSuite` annotation allows you to execute a function before executing a test suite. Similarly, the `AfterSuite` annotation can be used to execute a function after a test suite.

A module is considered as a suite in the Test framework. These annotations can be used to set up prerequisites and post actions for a test suite.
