# Client - Mutual SSL

Ballerina supports mutual SSL, which is a certificate-based authentication
process in which two parties (the client and server) authenticate each other by
verifying the digital certificates. It ensures that both parties are assured
of each other's identity.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [gRPC module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/grpc/latest/).
