# Service - SSL/TLS

You can use the GraphQL listener to connect to or interact with an HTTPS client. Provide the `graphql:ListenerSecureSocket` configurations to the server to expose an HTTPS connection.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`graphql` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).

::: code graphql_service_ssl_tls.bal :::
