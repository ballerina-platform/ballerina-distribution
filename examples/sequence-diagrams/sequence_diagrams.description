// The diagram has a lifeline (vertical line) for each worker (both named 
// worker and function's default worker).
// The diagram also has a lifeline for each client object parameter or variable in 
// the initialization section, representing the remote system to which the client 
// object is sending messages.
// Each remote method call on a client object is represented as a horizontal line
// between the lifeline of the worker making the call and the remote system.
