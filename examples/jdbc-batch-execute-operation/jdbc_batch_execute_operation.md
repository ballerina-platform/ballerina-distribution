# Batch execute

This BBE demonstrates how to use the JDBC client to execute a batch of DDL/DML operations. Note that the relevant database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency. 

>**Note:** This sample is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR needs to be added to the `Ballerina.toml` file. This sample is written using H2 2.0.6 and it is recommended to use an H2 JAR file of a version higher than 2.0.2.

For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [`jdbc` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/).

The following util files will initialize the test database before running the BBE and clean it up afterward.
