// This example demonstrates how to use the JDBC client to execute a batch of 
// DDL/DML operations. Note that the relevant database driver JAR
// should should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml file as a dependency. However, this sample
// is based on an H2 database and the H2 database driver JAR is included by
// default into the Ballerina distribution. Therefore, it is not required to
// copy the driver JAR for H2 databases.<br><br>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [JDBC module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/java.jdbc/latest/).
