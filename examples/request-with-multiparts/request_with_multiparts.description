// Ballerina supports encoding and decoding multipart content in http requests along with nested parts.
// When you request multiparts from the HTTP inbound request, you get an array of body parts (an array of entities).
// You can loop through this array and handle the received body parts according to your requirement.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [Mime module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/mime/latest/mime/).
