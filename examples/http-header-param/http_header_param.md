# Header parameter

The `http` module provides support for accessing inbound request headers as resource method arguments. The header key can be specified as a variable name along with the `@http:Header` annotation. Else, it can be specified in the `name` field of the annotation. The supported types are `string`, `string[]`, and optional. The `string[]` type returns all the values for a given header key while `string` returns the first value. Unless the type is optional, the request will be responded with a 400 Bad request in the absence of the mentioned header. However, more header manipulations can be done via the `http:Headers` header object, which also can be accessed as a resource method argument without using the annotation.

For more information on the underlying module, see the [`http` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/) 
and [specification](https://ballerina.io/spec/http/#2345-header-parameter).
