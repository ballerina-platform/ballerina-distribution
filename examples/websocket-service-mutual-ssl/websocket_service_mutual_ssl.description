// Ballerina supports mutual SSL, which is a certificate-based authentication
// process in which two parties (the client and server) authenticate each other by
// verifying the digital certificates. It ensures that both parties are assured
// of each other's identity.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [WebSocket module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/websocket/latest/).
