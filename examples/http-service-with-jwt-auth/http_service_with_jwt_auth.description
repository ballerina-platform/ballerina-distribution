// An HTTP service/resource can be secured using JWT and by enforcing
// authorization optionally. Then, it validates the JWT sent in the
// `Authorization` header against the provided configurations.<br/>
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). The scope can be included
// in the JWT using a custom claim attribute. That custom claim attribute
// also can be configured as the `scopeKey`.<br/>
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared
// against the scope included in the JWT for at least one match between the two
// sets.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [JWT module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/jwt/latest/jwt/).
