# Client

The FTP client is used to perform CRUD operation on remote files/directories
using the FTP protocol. This sample includes getting and putting file
content with default configurations using the default port number.

For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [FTP module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/ftp/latest/).
