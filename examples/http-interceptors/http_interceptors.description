// Interceptors are used to execute some common logic such as logging, header manipulation,
// state publishing, etc. for all the inbound requests and outbound responses. A 
// `RequestInterceptor` can be used to intercept the request and execute some custom
// logic. `RequestInterceptors` have a resource method, which will be executed
// before dispatching the request to the actual resource in the target service. In addition,
// a `ResponseInterceptor` can be used to intercept the response. `ResponseInterceptors`
// have a remote method, which will be executed before dispatching the response to the client.
// A collection of these interceptors can be configured as a pipeline at the listener level or service level.
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
