// This BBE demonstrates how to use the MySQL client to execute a stored
// procedure. Note that the MySQL database driver JAR should be defined in
// the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency.
// For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [MySQL module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql/latest/).
// The MySQL connector uses database properties from MySQL version 8.0.13 onwards. Therefore, it is
// recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.13.<br><br>
