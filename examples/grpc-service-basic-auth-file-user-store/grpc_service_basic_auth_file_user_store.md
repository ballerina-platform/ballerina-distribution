# Service - Basic Auth file user store

A gRPC service/resource can be secured with Basic Auth and optionally by enforcing authorization. Then, it validates the Basic Auth token sent as the `Authorization` metadata against the provided configurations. This reads data from a file, which has a TOML format. This stores the usernames, passwords for authentication, and scopes for authorization.

Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s).

In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared against the scope included in the user store for at least one match between the two sets.

The `Config.toml` file is used to store the usernames, passwords, and scopes. Each user can have a password and optionally assigned scopes as an array.

>**Info:** For more information on the underlying module, see the [`auth` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest/).

## Generate the service definition

1. Create a new Protocol Buffers definition file named `grpc_service.proto` and add the service definition to it.

    ::: code grpc_service.proto :::

2. Run the command below in the Ballerina tools distribution for stub generation.

    ::: out grpc_service.out :::

Once you run the command, the `grpc_service_pb.bal` file is generated inside the stubs directory.

>**Info:** For more information on how to use the Ballerina Protocol Buffers tool, see the [Proto To Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/proto-to-ballerina.html) example.

## Implement and run the service

1. Create a Ballerina package.

2. Copy the generated `grpc_secured_pb.bal` stub file to the package. For example, if you create a package named `service`, copy the stub file to the `service` package.

3. Create a new `grpc_service_basic_auth_file_user_store.bal` Ballerina file inside the `service` package and add the service implementation.

    >**Tip:** You may need to change the certificate file path and private key file path in the code below.  

   ::: code grpc_service_basic_auth_file_user_store.bal :::

4. As a prerequisite, execute the command below to populate the `Config.toml` file correctly with the user information.

    ```bash
    $ echo '[[ballerina.auth.users]]
    username="alice"
    password="password1"
    scopes=["scope1"]
    [[ballerina.auth.users]]
    username="bob"
    password="password2"
    scopes=["scope2", "scope3"]' > Config.toml
    ```

6. Execute the commands below to build and run the `service` package.

   ::: out grpc_service_basic_auth_file_user_store.server.out :::
