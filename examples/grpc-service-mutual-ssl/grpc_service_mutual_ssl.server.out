# Create a Ballerina package.
# Copy the generated `grpc_secured_pb.bal` stub file to the package.
# For example, if you create a package named `service`, copy the stub file to the `service` package.

# Create a new `grpc_service_mutual_ssl.bal` Ballerina file inside the `service` package and add the service implementation.

# Execute the command below to build the 'service' package.
# You may need to change the certificate file path, private key file path, and
# trusted certificate file path.
`bal build service`

# Run the service using the command below.
bal run service/target/bin/service.jar
