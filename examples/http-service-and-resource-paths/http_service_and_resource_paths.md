# REST service - Service and resource paths

The `service path` is defined in the service declaration and the `resource path` is defined in the resource method definition. Each resource can be invoked by using the `service path`, `resource path`, and `resource accessor`. In an HTTP resource, the `resource accessor` confines the resource to a specific HTTP method.

::: code http_service_and_resource_paths.bal :::

Run the service as follows.

::: out http_service_and_resource_paths.server.out :::

Invoke the service by executing the following cURL command in a new terminal.

::: out http_service_and_resource_paths.client.out :::
