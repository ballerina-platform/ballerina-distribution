# HTTP 2.0 server push

HTTP/2 server push messages can be sent and received using the Ballerina `http` library.
HTTP/2 Server Push messages allow the server to send resources to the client before the client requests for it.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [HTTP module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
