// Ballerina's concurrency model is based on strands. An execution thread is divided into multiple strands. 
// In this manner, multiple strands belonging to a single thread are cooperatively multitasked. 
// This behavior is especially useful in non-blocking I/O communication, where a single thread can cooperatively 
// execute I/O operations simultaneously, without a single strand blocking the thread. <br/>

// A realization of a strand in Ballerina code is done using a worker. A worker represents a single strand 
// of a function execution. A function has a default worker which is unnamed, and it can also have zero or more named workers.
