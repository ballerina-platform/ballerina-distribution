# Interceptors

The GraphQL `interceptors` can be used to execute custom logic before and after the resolver function gets invoked. It can be defined as a read-only service class, which infers the `graphql:Interceptor` service object. The interceptor service class should have the implementation of the `execute(graphql:Context context, graphql:Field 'field)` remote method which is provided by the interceptor service object. The custom logic can be included in this remote method. The interceptors should be provided using the `graphql:ServiceConfig` parameter named `interceptors` which accepts an array of interceptor instances.

Interceptors follow the `onion principle` when executing. Also, the inserting order of the interceptor instances into the array will be the execution order of the Interceptors.
