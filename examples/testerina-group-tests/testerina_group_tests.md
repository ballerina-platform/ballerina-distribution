# Group tests

You can tag your test cases with a single group name or multiple group names (one or more).
This allows you to control the execution of selected tests.<br/><br/>
In order to execute tests belonging to a selected test group, you can name the 
test groups that are to be executed when you run the tests.
Likewise, you can exclude executing the selected test groups as well.<br/><br/>
