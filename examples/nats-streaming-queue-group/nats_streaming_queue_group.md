# Queue groups

The `nats` streaming library provides the built-in load balancing
feature called "distributed queues". All subscribers with the
same queue name form the queue group.  As messages on the registered
subject are published, one member of the group is chosen randomly
to receive the message. Although queue groups have multiple subscribers,
each message is consumed by only one.<br/><br/>
