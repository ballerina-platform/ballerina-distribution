# Queue groups

The `nats` streaming library provides the built-in load balancing feature called "distributed queues". All subscribers with the same queue name form the queue group.  As messages on the registered subject are published, one member of the group is chosen randomly to receive the message. Although queue groups have multiple subscribers, each message is consumed by only one.

For more information on the underlying module,  see the [`stan` module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/stan/latest).

The `queue-group.bal` contains three services belonging to the same queue group.

When several messages are published, it can be noticed that each message is received by only one queue group member.
