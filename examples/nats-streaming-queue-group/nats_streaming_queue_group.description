// This sample demonstrates leveraging the NATS built-in load balancing
// feature called "distributed queues". All subscribers with the
// same queue name form the queue group.  As messages on the registered
// subject are published, one member of the group is chosen randomly
// to receive the message. Although queue groups have multiple subscribers,
// each message is consumed by only one.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [NATS module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerinax/nats/latest).
