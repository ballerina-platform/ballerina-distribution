# DML and DDL operation

This BBE demonstrates how to use the MySQL client with the DDL and  DML
operations. Note that the MySQL database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency.
For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [MySQL module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql/latest/).
The MySQL connector uses database properties from MySQL version 8.0.13 onwards. Therefore, it is
recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.13.<br><br>
