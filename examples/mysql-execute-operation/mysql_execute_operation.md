# DML and DDL operation

This BBE demonstrates how to use the MySQL client with the DDL and  DML operations. 

>**Note:** The MySQL database driver JAR should be defined in the `Ballerina.toml` file as a dependency.The MySQL connector uses database properties from MySQL version 8.0.13 onwards. Therefore, it is recommended to use a MySQL driver version greater than 8.0.13.

For a sample configuration and more information on the underlying module, see the [MySQL module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/mysql/latest/).
