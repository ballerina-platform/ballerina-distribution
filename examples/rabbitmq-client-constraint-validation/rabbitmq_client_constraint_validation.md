# RabbitMQ client - Constraint validation

The Ballerina constraint module allows you to add additional constraints to the message content. The constraints can be added to a given data type using different annotations. When a message with a constraint is received from the RabbitMQ server, it is validated internally. This validation happens soon after the successful data-binding of the message content before returning the message record. If the validation fails, the `rabbitmq:PayloadValidationError` error is returned. Use this to validate the message content as the application receives it, which allows you to guard against unnecessary message content processing and malicious content.
