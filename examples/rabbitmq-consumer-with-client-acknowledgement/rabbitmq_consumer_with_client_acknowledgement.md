# RabbitMQ service - Consumer with acknowledgement

The `rabbitmq:Caller` allows manual acknowledgments for the consumed messages. A `rabbitmq:Listener` is created by passing the host and port of the RabbiMQ broker. A `rabbitmq:Service` attached to the `rabbitmq:Listener` can be used to listen to a specific subject and consume incoming messages. To enable manual acknowledgments, set the `autoAck` mode in `rabbitmq:ServiceConfig` to `false`. The `rabbitmq:Caller` can be used to acknowledge the message positively or negatively using the `basicAck` and `basicNack` functions. Use it to manually acknowledge the consumed messages.
