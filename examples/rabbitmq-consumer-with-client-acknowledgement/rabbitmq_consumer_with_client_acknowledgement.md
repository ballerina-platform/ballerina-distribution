# Client acknowledgements

The messages are consumed from an
existing queue using the Ballerina RabbitMQ message listener.
The received messages are acknowledged manually.
By default, the ackMode is rabbitmq:AUTO_ACK, which will automatically acknowledge
all messages once consumed.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [RabbitMQ module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/rabbitmq/latest).
