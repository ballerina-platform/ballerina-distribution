# CORS

The CORS headers can be applied in both the service-level and the resource-level. Service-level CORS headers apply to all the resources
unless there are headers configured at the resource-level. Ballerina CORS supports both simple and pre-flight requests.<br/><br/>
For more information on the underlying module, 
see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
