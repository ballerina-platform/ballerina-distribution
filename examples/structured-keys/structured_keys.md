# Structured keys

Key fields can be structured types as long as they belong to any subtype of plain data. Plain data is a simple value, a sequence value, or a structured value where all members are plain data. The value of the key field must be immutable. The initializer of the read-only field will be constructed as immutable. When using `add`/`put`, `cloneReadOnly()` can be used to create an immutable value.
