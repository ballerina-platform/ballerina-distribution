// Named workers have a return type, which defaults to nil.
// A `return` statement in a named worker terminates
// the worker, not the function.
// Similarly, when `check` is used and the expression evaluates
// to an `error`, the `error` value is returned terminating the worker.
// Waiting on a named worker will give its return value.
