# FTP client - Send file

The `ftp:Client` connects to a given FTP server, and then sends and receives files as byte streams. An `ftp:Client` is created by giving the host-name and required credentials. Once connected, `put` method is used to write files as byte streams to the FTP server. Use this to transfer files from a local file system to a remote file system.
