// In addition to `RequestInterceptors`, a `ResponseInterceptor` can be used to intercept the response.
// `ResponseInterceptors` have a remote method, which will be executed before dispatching the response 
// to the client. A collection of these request and response interceptors can be configured as a pipeline
// at the listener level or service level. 
// For more information, see the [HTTP module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/http/latest/).
