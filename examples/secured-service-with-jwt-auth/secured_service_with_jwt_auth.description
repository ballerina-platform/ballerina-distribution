// A service can be secured using JWT and optionally by enforcing
// authorization. The JWT auth provider verifies the signature of the JWT
// sent in the Authorization header. For this, Ballerina should trust the
// JWT issuer (the certificate of the JWT issuer must be present in the Ballerina
// certificate truststore). Alternatively, the signature of the JWT can be verified
// using the configured JWKs endpoint.
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s). The scope can be included
// in the JWT using the `scope` attribute.
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the resource are compared against
// the scopes mapped to the user for at least one match between the two sets.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module, 
// see the [JWT module](https://ballerina.io/swan-lake/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/jwt/latest/jwt/).
