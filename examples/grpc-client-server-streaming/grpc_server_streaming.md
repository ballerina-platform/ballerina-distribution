# gRPC client - Server-side streaming RPC

A `grpc:Client` is created by providing the endpoint URL of a gRPC server. In the server streaming scenario, once connected, the client sends a request message to the remote service and gets a message stream as the response, which contains multiple messages. Use this to send a single request message and get multiple response messages back.

## Generate the service definition

1. Create a new Protocol Buffers definition file `grpc_server_streaming.proto` and add service definition below.

    ::: code grpc_server_streaming.proto :::

2. Run the command below in the Ballerina tools distribution for stub generation.

   ::: out grpc_server_streaming.out :::

Once you run the command, the `grpc_server_streaming_pb.bal` file gets generated inside the stubs directory.

## Prerequisites
- Run the gRPC service given in the [gRPC service - Server-side streaming RPC](/learn/by-example/grpc-service-server-streaming/) example.

## Implement and run the client

1. Create a Ballerina package (e.g., `client`). Delete the `main.bal` file created by default as it is not required for this example.

2. Copy the generated `grpc_server_streaming_pb.bal` file from the `stubs` directory to the  `client` package.

3. Create a new `grpc_server_streaming_client.bal` file inside the `client` package and add the client implementation below.

   ::: code grpc_server_streaming_service_client.bal :::

4. Run the client by executing the command below.

   ::: out grpc_server_streaming_service_client.out :::
