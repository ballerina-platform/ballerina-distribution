# WebSocket client - Payload constraint validation

The Ballerina constraint package allows you to add additional constraints to the received payload. Through client payload constraint validation, the payload can be validated according to the defined constraints. The constraint validation happens along with the data binding step in the `readMessage` remote method. Constraints can be added to a given data type using different annotations. If the validation fails, a `PayloadBindingError` will be returned with the validation details. Use this to validate the receiving payload, which allows you to guard against unnecessary processing and malicious payloads.
