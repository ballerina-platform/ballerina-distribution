# Assertions

Testerina has in-built assertions that enable you to assert an outcome against an expected outcome. This example illustrates how to use different assertions.

For more information, see [Testing Ballerina Code](https://ballerina.io/learn/test-ballerina-code/write-tests/#use-assertions) and the [Test Module](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/test/latest/).
