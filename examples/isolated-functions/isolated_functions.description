// A call to an `isolated` function is concurrency-safe if it is called with arguments
// that are safe at least until the call returns. <br></br>
// A function defined as `isolated`:
// <ul>
// <li>has access to mutable state only through its parameters</li>
// <li>has unrestricted access to immutable state</li>
// <li>can only call functions that are `isolated`</li>
// </ul>
// <br></br>
// <p>Constraints are enforced at compile-time. `isolated` is a part of the function type.
// Weaker concept than pure function.</p>
