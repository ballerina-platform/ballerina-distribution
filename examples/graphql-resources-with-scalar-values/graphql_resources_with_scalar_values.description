// In Ballerina GraphQL, a service represents the GraphQL endpoint.
// Each resource function inside the service represents a resolver function for a field in the root Query type.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://ballerina.io/learn/api-docs/ballerina/#/ballerina/graphql/latest/graphql/).<br/><br/>
// This example shows a simple GraphQL endpoint that has a single field in the root Query type, which returns a string.
