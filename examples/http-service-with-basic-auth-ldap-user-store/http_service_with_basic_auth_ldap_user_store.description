// An HTTP service/resource can be secured using Basic auth and by enforcing
// authorization optionally. Then, it validates the Basic auth token sent in
// the `Authorization` header against the provided configurations. This reads
// data from the configured LDAP. This stores usernames, passwords for
// authentication, and scopes for authorization.<br/>
// Ballerina uses the concept of scopes for authorization. A resource declared
// in a service can be bound to one/more scope(s).<br/>
// In the authorization phase, the scopes of the service/resource are compared
// against the scope included in the user store for at least one match between
// the two sets.<br/><br/>
// For more information on the underlying module,
// see the [Auth module](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/auth/latest/auth/).
