# Send a HTTP multipart request to upload a single file via the GraphQL endpoint using a cURL command.
# The first part of the request is `operations` that includes a `JSON-encoded` map value.
# The `operations` map value is similar to a standard GraphQL POST request, in which all the variable values related to the file upload are `null`.
# `operations`: { "query": "mutation($file: Upload!) { singleFileUpload(file: $file) }", "variables": {"file": null} }

# The second part of the request is a `map` field that includes a `JSON-encoded` map of files that occurred in the operations.
# The `key` is file field name and the `value` is an array of paths in which the files occurred in the `operations`.
# `map`: { “0”: ["variables.file"] }

# A file can be added to the next part of the request with a unique, arbitrary field name.

 curl localhost:4000/fileUpload \
  -F operations='{ "query": "mutation($file: Upload!) { singleFileUpload(file: $file) }", "variables": { "file": null } }' \
  -F map='{ "0": ["variables.file"] }' \
  -F 0=@file1.png
 {"data":{"singleFileUpload":"Successfully Uploaded"}}

# Now, send a request with multiple files.
# The variable value related to the files is an array of `null` values.
# `operations`: { "query": "mutation($file: [Upload!]!) { multipleFileUpload(files: $file) }", "variables": { "file": [null, null] } }

# Same as the single file upload, the `map` value is a JSON-encoded map of paths in which files occurred in the `operations`.
# Since the `operations` has an array of `null` values, an array index is included in the path value.
#  E.g., In `file.0`, `0` is the array index.
# `map`: { "0": ["variables.file.0"], "1": ["variables.file.1"]}

# Files can be added to the next fields of the request with a unique, arbitrary field name.
# 0=@file1.png
# 1=@file2.png
