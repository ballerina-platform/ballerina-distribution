// GraphQL package provides a way to upload files through the GraphQL endpoints with GraphQL mutations. To define
// an endpoint with the file upload capability, the `graphql:Upload` type can be used as the input parameter of
// resolver functions. The `graphql:Upload` type can represent the details of the file that needs to be uploaded and
// that can be used only with the remote functions. The value of `graphql:Upload` type is extracted from the HTTP
// multipart request, which will be received by the GraphQL endpoints. This example shows how to implement a GraphQL endpoint that
// can be used to upload files.

// For more information on the underlying package, see the
// [GraphQL package](https://docs.central.ballerina.io/ballerina/graphql/latest/).
