# Kafka producer - Produce message

The `kafka:Producer` connects to a given Kafka server, and then sends messages to a specific topic in the server. A `kafka:Producer` is created by giving the Kafka server url. Once connected, `send` method is used to send messages to the Kafka server by providing the relevant topic and the value as the parameters. `anydata` and subtypes of `anydata` can be provided as the values, and these will be serialized using the built-in byte array serializer internally when sending to the server. Use this to send messages to a topic in the Kafka server.
