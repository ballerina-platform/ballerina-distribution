// The `cloneWithType()` langlib function in the lang.value
// module can be used to convert a value to a user-defined type.
// Result recursively uses specified type as inherent type of new value.
// Automatically performs numeric conversions as necessary.
// Every part of the value is cloned including immutable structural values.
// Graph structure is not preserved. 
// Variant `fromJsonWithType()` also does reverse of conversions done by
// `toJson`.
