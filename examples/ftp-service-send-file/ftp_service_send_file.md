# FTP service - Send file

The `ftp:Service` connects to a given FTP server via the `ftp:Listener`. Once connected, the service starts receiving events every time a file is deleted or added to the server. To take action for these events `ftp:Caller` is used. The `ftp:Caller` can be specified as a parameter of `onFileChange` remote method. The `ftp:Caller` allows interacting with the server via `get`, `append`, `delete`, etc remote methods. Use this to listen to file changes occurring in a remote file system and take action for those changes.
