# Table syntax

A `table` is a collection of records. Each `record` represents a row of the `table`.
A `table` is plain data if and only if its rows are plain data. A `table` maintains an invariant
that each row is uniquely identified by a key. Each rowâ€™s key is stored in fields, which
must be immutable. <br/><br/>
Compared to maps,
<ul>
<li>key is part of the value rather than being separate.</li>
<li>The type of the key is not restricted to `string`.</li>
<li>The order of the members is preserved.</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>
<p>A `record` field can be declared as `readonly`. A value cannot be assigned to such a field
after the record is created. The `table` type gives the type of the row and the name of the key field.
The `table constructor expression` looks like an `array constructor`. The `foreach` statement will
iterate over a table's rows in their order. Use `t[k]` to access a row using its key.</p>
