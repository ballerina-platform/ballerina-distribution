# Create a new Protocol Buffers definition file named `grpc_simple.proto` and add the service definition.
# Run the command below from the Ballerina tools distribution for stub generation.
`bal grpc --input grpc_simple.proto  --output stubs`

# Once you run the command, the `grpc_simple_pb.bal` file is generated inside the `stubs` directory.

# For more information on how to use the Ballerina Protocol Buffers tool, see the [Proto To Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/learn/by-example/proto-to-ballerina.html) example.
