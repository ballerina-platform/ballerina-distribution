// Langlib is a small library defined by language providing fundamental operations on built-in data types.
// Langlib functions can be called using convenient method-call syntax, but these types are not objects!
// There exists a `ballerina/lang.T` module for each built-in type `T` and they are automatically imported
// using `T` prefix.
